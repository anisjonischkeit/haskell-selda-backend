# backend

## Building

```
git clone git@github.com:anisjonischkeit/haskell-selda-backend.git
docker-compose build
```

NOTE: Recompiling without rebuilding the docker image did work before I pulled
this out of the main project but I haven't been bothered to fix it. If anyone
wants to see it I can fix that up.

## Running

```
docker-compose up
```
